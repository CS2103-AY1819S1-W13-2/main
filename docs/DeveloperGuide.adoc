By: `Team W13-2`      Since: `Sept 2018`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the EventsPlus+ branding and refer to the `CS2103-AY1819S1-W13-2/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product, you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagramUpdated.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `SystemChangedEvent` when the application's data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagramUpdated.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagramUpdated.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `SystemParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagramUpdated.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the application's data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Tag>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagramUpdated.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the application's data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.System.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//tag::favourite[]
=== Select an existing event to be detailed in the notification if notification is enabled.
==== Current Implementation

Details of favourite event (i.e. event name, date, day, time, details) stored as a String "Favourite" in preferences.json file.
The favourite mechanism is implemented through the ModelManager.
Upon startup, if notification is enabled, and there is a String "favourite" in preferences.json is non-null, the notification will display the String "favourite".
"Favourite" in preferences.json is also loaded into ModelManager.
Upon executing FavouriteCommand, the event is selected based on the input parameters and the filteredEventsListByDate.
The attributes of the event is formatted into a String and saved to the ModelManager.
Upon exit, the formatted String in ModelManager is saved to preferences.json to ensure statefulness.

* `logic#parser#FavouriteCommandParser()` -- creates a FavouriteCommand object based on user's inputs.
* `logic#commands#FavouriteCommand()` -- updates the ModelManager's favouriteEvent attribute.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the favourite mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The model's favouriteEvent attribute is initially null.

Step 2. The user executes `favourite d/2018-04-01 i/1`. The `favourite` command calls FavouriteCommandParser which checks validity of user inputs and creates a new FavouriteCommand which selects the event and create a formatted String from the event details.

[NOTE]
The favourite command will update favouriteEvent regardless of whether the new favouriteEvent String is the same as the existing String.

==== Design Considerations

==== Aspect: How favourite is updated

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Re-assign Model's favouriteEvent regardless of previous preference
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Wasteful in the case of same favorite event.
* **Alternative 2:** Check current favouriteEvent and only assign new value if it is different from the previous value.
** Pros: Do not waste computing cycles on unecessary re-assingment of favouriteEvent.
** Cons: Code becomes more complicated because additional check required.

===== Aspect: Writing to preferences.json

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Write all Model preferences to preferences.json
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Unecessary computing cycles wasted on writing when possibly no change
* **Alternative 2:** Check for difference between Model preferences and preferences.json, only write to preferences.json if there is difference.
** Pros: Efficient.
** Cons: Code becomes more complicated because additional check required
// end::notification[]

//tag::notification[]
=== Enable/Disable Notification feature
==== Current Implementation

Notification preference is stored in the preferences.json file.
The notification mechanism is facilitated by Javafx.
Upon startup, notification preference is loaded from preferences.json and saved to the ModelManager.
Upon exit, the model's notification preference is saved to preferences.json to ensure statefulness.
When enabled, it creates a child stage and scene from the main window and displays with a countdown timer to automatically close the stage.
Additionally, it implements the following operations

* `ui#NotificationWindow()` -- creates the stage and scene for the notification using 2 String inputs: `title` and `message`
* `logic#parser#NotificationCommandParser()` -- creates a NotificationCommand object based on user's input
* `logic#commands#NotificationCommand()` -- updates the ModelManager's notificationPref attribute.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the enable/disable notification mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The model's notification preference is initally enabled, the notification window appears.

Step 2. The user executes `notification disable`. The `notification` command calls NotificationCommandParser which converts `disable` into the boolean `false` and creates a new Notification Command which updates the Model's notification preference to false.

[NOTE]
The notification command will update the notification preference regardless of whether the new preference is same as the previous preference.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How notification preferences is updated

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Re-assign Model's notification preference regardless of previous preference
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Wasteful in the case of same notification preference.
* **Alternative 2:** Check current notification preference and only assign new value if it is different from the previous value.
** Pros: Do not waste computing cycles on unecessary re-assingment of notification preference.
** Cons: Code becomes more complicated because additional check required.

** Cons: Unecessary computing cycles wasted on writing when possibly no change
* **Alternative 2:** Check for difference between Model preferences and preferences.json, only write to preferences.json if there is difference.
** Pros: Efficient.
** Cons: Code becomes more complicated because additional check required
// end::notification[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSystem`.
It extends `System` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `SystemStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSystem#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedSystem#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedSystem#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSystem()`, `Model#undoSystem()` and `Model#redoSystem()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSystem` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitSystem()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `SystemStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitSystem()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `SystemStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitSystem()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `SystemStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoSystem()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSystem()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoSystem()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `SystemStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSystem()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitSystem()`, `Model#undoSystem()` or `Model#redoSystem()`. Thus, the `SystemStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitSystem()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `SystemStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedSystem`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

[[AddDeleteEvents]]
// tag::events[]
=== Add/Delete Events feature

==== Current Implementation
===== Structure of an Event
In the `Model` component, an `Event` consists of various `Event` attributes.
Namely, the classes `EventName`, `EventDescription`, `EventDate`, `EventTime`, `EventAddress` are used to represent respective information in an `Event`,
as shown in the Class diagram below. Note that `EventDay` is generated from `EventDate` values, and each event also contains a `Set` of `Person` and `Tag` objects,
which are used to represent the event contacts (from the address book) and event tags (from <<EventTags, event tags>> currently existing in the address book). +

By doing so, we achieve more abstraction and cohesion, and this abides by the Separation of Concerns (SoC) principle at the class level.
On top of facilitating checking of bugs within the individual attributes,
doing so will also allow the developer to alter the definition of the different attribute classes, as well as to add more attributes into the
`Event` class easily.

image::Event.png[Event class]

===== Adding/Deleting of an Event
Methods have been added to `ModelManager`, `AddressBook` and the newly-added class `UniqueEventList` to facilitate adding and deleting of events.
In order to limit modification of the internal list of `Event` objects, changes to this list is only carried out at the most fundamental level,
which is `UniqueEventList`. `AddressBook` stores a reference to this internal list, and `ModelManager` stores an unmodifiable copy of this list.

An example usage scenario of the adding of events is as shown in the sequence diagram below.
The diagram shows the interaction between the different components in the system when an event is added.
The interaction between components is similar for the deletion of an event.

image::add-event-component.png[Interactions between components]

More specific interactions between `Logic` and `Model` are as shown in the diagram below.

image::add-event_logic-model.png[Interactions between Logic and Model, width="800"]

Step 1. User enters command to add an event +
Step 2. `AddressBookParser` calls `AddEventCommandParser`, which generates an `AddEventCommand` with an `Event` and `Set<Index>`. The latter specifies the contact indices to add into the event. +
Step 3. `AddEventCommand` calls `Model#hasEvent`, `Model#hasClashingEvent`, `Model#hasEventTag` to check if the event information is valid +
Step 4. `AddEventCommand` calls `Event#setEventContacts` to set the `Set<Person>` of event contacts (Each `Person` has to be in the existing address book records) +
Step 5. `AddEventCommand` calls `Model#addEvent` after all checks have passed. The event is added into the system from the `Model` component. +

For deletion of event(s), the flow is similar.
The sequence diagram for the deletion of event is shown below.

image::delete-event-condensed_logic-model.png[Deleting an event, width="800"]

Step 1. User enters command to delete an event based on the event date and index (as displayed in the UI) +
Step 2. `AddressBookParser` calls `DeleteEventCommandParser`, which generates an `DeleteEventCommand` with an `EventDate` and `Index`. +
Step 3. `DeleteEventCommand` <<gettingAnEvent, gets the event>>.
Step 4. The event from step 3 is deleted from the system from the `Model` component. +

[[gettingAnEvent]]
Events are retrieved based on their date and index in the displayed events list, as shown in the diagram below.

image::get-event.png[Getting an event]

For the case of `DeleteEventCommand`, we let `XYZCommand` be `DeleteEventCommand`.
Step 1. `DeleteEventCommand` calls `Model#getFilteredEventListByDate` to retrieve the last shown event list. +
Step 2. `DeleteEventCommand` calls `getTargetDateList` to retrieve the list from which the event belongs to.  +
Step 3. `DeleteEventCommand` calls `getEvent` to retrieve the event based on its index in the list from step 2. +

Upon adding/deletion of events in `Model`, `AddressBookChangedEvent`, `AddressBookEventChangedEvent` and `EventPanelDisplayChangedEvent`
are triggered from the `Model` component.
The raised events are handled by:

* `UI`, which updates the displayed information and updates the active tab to the Events tab, and
* `Storage`, which saves the information to an XML data file.

For instance, when an `Event` is added (or deleted), the event triggers are handled as follows.

image::add-event_event-trigger.png[Handling of triggered events]

===== UI Events Display
To display the event information according to their date, a list of lists of events grouped by `EventDate` is set in the `ListView` object in the `EventPanelList`.
Each cell represents the `EventListCard` for a particular date, which contains all the events, each displayed in a `EventCard`. For this implementation,
we require `ModelManager` to be able to return such an `ObservableList<List<Event>>` object to the UI class `MainWindow`, and this is achieved via the method
`ModelManager#getFilteredEventListByDate`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Data Structure to Support the UI Events Display

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store a list of type `ObservableList<List<Event>>` in the `ListView` object in the `EventPanelList`.
This list is re-computed from `Model` each time a change in the internal list of events is detected, and the
updated list is passed to the UI class `MainWindow`.
This facilitates a regeneration of the `TabPanel` stored in `MainWindow`, updating the display of events to the user.

+

** *Pros:* We only need to maintain one internal list of `Event` objects. For the UI
to be updated with new information whenever events are added into/deleted from the underlying `Event` list,
we make use of a listener on the `filteredEvents` list in `Model`.

*** Whenever there is a change detected by `filteredEvents`, an `AddressBookEventChangedEvent` is posted
*** `MainWindow` resets its `TabPanel` and passes the re-computed list (events grouped by date) into it.

image::ui-display-ad.png[Refresh of Tab Panel on Event Change, width="800"]

** *Cons:* There is a regeneration of the `TabPanel` object in `MainWindow` each time such an event occurs.
However, this overhead is still acceptable given the current scale of the `AddressBook`.

* **Alternative 2:** Store a list of type `ObservableList<ObservableList<Event>>` in `UI` and `Model`,
where each `ObservableList<Event>` is the list of events for a given date.
Update this alongside the `filteredEvent` list in `Model`, by adding a listener to `filteredEvents`,
such that each time the internal list of events changes, the corresponding update is performed on the 2D-list.

** *Pros:* There is no need to regenerate the list for `UI`, since information in this list stays updated.
This reduces overhead incurred in list regeneration.

+

** *Cons*: If more actions are carried out on the internal event list, the listener will have to be updated,
as it will have to listen to more types of changes. This could potentially create more bugs in the code.

* **Alternative 3:** Store a list of type `ObservableList<ObservableList<Event>>` (similar structure as in Alternative 2) in `UI` and `Model`.
Create another internal list `UniqueEventListByDate` for this list of lists. Update this alongside `UniqueEventList`.

** *Pros:*
*** There is no need to regenerate the list for `UI`, since information in this list stays updated.
*** No listener is required, since an event can be added to `UniqueEventList` and `UniqueEventListByDate` simultaneously.

** *Cons:* Two lists have to be maintained, both storing the same `Event` objects.
The task of maintaining two lists may lead to inconsistencies between the two lists and more complex code in future.

===== Aspect: Restrictions on Event Tags
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Valid event tags to be restricted to a list which can be edited by the user.
** *Pros:* Allows event tags to be standardized, and the user can keep track of the all the types of events he/she has just
by referring to the `Flowpane` containing all the event tags available in the system. This also facilitates finding of events
by event tags.
** *Cons:* More work has to be done from the user's end, as he/she has to add an event tag in the system
before adding an event with that tag.

* **Alternative 2:** No restriction to event tags.
** *Pros:* Less work by the user, as he/she can just add any event tag when adding an event into the system.
** *Cons:* Less standardization of event tags, which may cause the user's data to become more disorganized in future.

* **Alternative 3:** (2-in-1 approach) Event tags that are non-existing in EventsPlus+ to be added upon adding an event with that new tag.
** *Pros:* Less work by the user, and tag gets automatically added into the system.
** *Cons:* The `addEvent` command will be performing two different actions - adding an event
and adding an event tag. This may violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) for the `AddEventCommand` class.
// end::events[]

[[seeEventContacts]]
//tag::seeEventContacts[]
=== See Event Contacts feature
==== Current Implementation
To obtain an event's contacts, comparisons are done using `Person#isSamePerson` to check if for each event contact, there exists a person in the system
who is the same person as the contact. By the use of a `Predicate` with this logic, we then apply the filter on `filteredPersons` in `Model`.

The sequence diagram below shows a typical usage of the feature.
The flow for getting an event using date and index is the same as in <<gettingAnEvent, getEvent>>.

image::see-event-contacts-condensed_logic-model.png[Interactions between Logic and Model, width="800"]

Step 1. User enters command to see an event's contacts. +
Step 2. `AddressBookParser` calls `SeeEventContactsCommandParser`, which generates a SeeEventContactsCommand` with an `EventDate` and `Index` +
Step 3. `SeeEventContactsCommand` <<gettingAnEvent, gets the event>>. +
Step 4. A `ExistingPersonInEventPredicate` is created based on the event's contacts from the event retrieved in Step 3. +
Step 5. `SeeEventContactsCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredEventList` to filter the displayed list using the `Predicate` object generated in step 4. +

==== Considerations
The displayed person list shown using this feature is aligned with the contact information displayed in the UI when hovering over the event contact. +
Namely, both the displayed person list and information displayed in the UI are obtained by checking if there is a same person as the person originally
added into the event (using `Person#isSamePerson`) in the system. If there is, the information is shown; else, the person is regarded as
having been deleted from the system. +
More specific scenarios are as follows:

* When an event contact is deleted from EventsPlus+, the `seeEventContacts` command would not display the person in the filtered list.
Simultaneously, when hovering over the event contact, the user would see a message indicating that the person has been deleted from the system.
This is so that users can still see the person as related to the event (when the event is first added),
even when the person's contact details no longer exist in the address book.

* When an event contact is edited in EventsPlus+, if the edited person is still the same person (using `Person#isSamePerson`) as the original person,
`seeEventContacts` would display the edited person. When hovering over the contact, the edited person would also be displayed.

* When an event contact is edited in EventsPlus+, if the edited person is no longer the same person (using `Person#isSamePerson`),
`seeEventContacts` would not display the original nor edited person. When hovering over the contact, if there is no such person in the
system who is the same person as the person originally added into EventsPlus+,
the user would see a message indicating that the person has been deleted from the system.
//end::seeEventContacts[]

[[EditEventAddress]]
//tag::editEventAddress[]
=== Edit Event Address feature
==== Current Implementation
To edit an event's existing address, the system first retrieves the event from the address book. This process is similar to that for
deleting an event. A new `Event` object is created with the same details as the old `Event` object, but with the updated `EventAddress`.
This new `Event` replaces the old one in the address book in the `Model#updateEvent` method, i.e. the old `Event` object is removed
from the internal list, and the new one set in its position.

The overall flow between the `Logic` and `Model` component when editing an event address's tag is as follows.
The flow for getting an event using date and index is the same as in <<gettingAnEvent, getEvent>>.

image::edit-event-address-condensed_logic-model.png[Interactions between Logic and Model, width="800"]

Step 1. User enters command to edit an event's address based on the event date and index (as displayed in the UI) +
Step 2. `AddressBookParser` calls `EditEventAddressCommandParser`, which generates an `EditEventAddressCommand` with an `EventDate`, `Index`
and the updated `EventAddress`. +
Step 3. `EditEventAddressCommand` <<gettingAnEvent, gets the event>>.
Step 4. A new event with all details (except `EventAddress`) duplicated from the old event in step 3 is created. +
The `EventAddress` attribute of this new event is set to the updated `EventAddress` passed in to `EditEventAddressCommand` in step 2. +
Step 5. The old event is replaced with the new one in the system from the `Model` component, through the execution of `Model#updateEvent`.

==== Considerations
When editing an event, there are several possible values that can be updated, including the event's name, description, etc.
However, this functionality is mainly catered to complement the `suggestLocation` functionality, whereby the user
can first add an event without specifying any location (and address will be displayed as TBD), and
edit the suggested location in afterwards.
//end::editEventAddress[]

[[EventTags]]
// tag::eventTags[]
=== Add Event Tags feature
==== Current Implementation
The list of event tags in the system is stored in a `UniqueTagList` in `Model`.
This implementation requires all event `Tag` objects to be unique (using case-insensitive comparison) +
All event tags are always shown, hence it is sufficient to
to keep an `ObservableList<Tag>` in `ModelManager`, rather than a `FilteredList` which is used to store list of `Person` and `Event` objects.

An event tag specified by the user is added in the system as depicted in the sequence diagram below.

image::add-event-tag_logic-model.png[Interactions between Logic and Model, width="800"]

Step 1. User enters command to add an event tag. +
Step 2. `AddressBookParser` calls `AddEventTagCommandParser`, which generates an `AddEventTagCommand` with a `Set` of `Tag` object. +
Step 3. `AddEventTagCommand` calls `Model#hasEventTag` to check for duplicate tags already in the system. +
Step 4. `AddEventTagCommand` calls `Model#addEventTag` to add the new event `Tag` into `Model`.
// end::eventTags[]

[[filteringEvents]]
//tag::filterEvents[]
=== Filtering of Events
[[findEvent]]
==== Find Event (by tag) feature
===== Current Implementation
To find events by their tags, we make use of a `Predicate`. The `EventTagMatchesKeywordsPredicate` is used in filtering
all events which have at least one tag matching at least one of the keywords provided by the user.

image::find-event_logic-model.png[Interactions between Logic and Model, width="800"]

Step 1. User enters command to find events with certain tags. +
Step 2. `AddressBookParser` calls `FindEventCommandParser`, which generates an `FindEventCommand` with an `EventTagMatchesKeywordsPredicate`. +
Step 3. `FindEventCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredEventList` to filter the displayed list using the `Predicate` generated in step 2. +

Similar to the other event-related commands, the list-filtering is done in `Model`, and
the change is propagated to the `UI` component by triggering an event. The details of the event triggers are as follows.

image::find-event_event-triggers.png[Handling of triggered events]

[[listEvent]]
==== Listing of all events
===== Current Implementation
To list all events, we make use of a `Predicate` which is always true (the `PREDICATE_LIST_ALL_EVENTS` constant).

image::list-event_logic-model.png[Interactions between Logic and Model, width="800"]

The `UI` components are updated using a similar flow (by event triggers) to the <<findEvent, find event>> feature. +
*Note:* The inclusion of the `EventDisplayPanelChangedEvent` is required in `Model#updateFilteredEventList`
so that `TabPanel` can switch to the event tab automatically whenever any of these commands are executed,
even if there is no change to data in the filtered list
(for example, when `listEvent` is executed even though all events are already currently listed).
//end::filterEvents[]

[[Autocomplete]]
// tag::autoComplete[]
=== Command Auto-completion feature
==== Current Implementation
Command auto-completion uses a fixed list of all command words in EventsPlus+. Each time the user
presses the `Tab` key, a check is run against the internal list of command words (including aliases)
and the input is auto-completed to the nearest command word containing the current user input, if any.
The following activity diagram outlines the typical usage of this feature.

image::autocomplete-ad.png[Auto-complete command activity diagram, width="800"]

==== Aspect: Computing the nearest valid command word
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each time the `Tab` key is pressed,
`String#startsWithPrefix` is used to check against the internal list for the nearest possible
command word.

** *Pros:* The implementation is neater as most of the checking is done by `String#startsWithPrefix`.
** *Cons:* The current input has to be checked against potentially every valid command word.

* **Alternative 2:** Store a `HashMap` with maps every possible prefix of every command word to the corresponding command word.
Do a lookup in the `HashMap` using current user input as the key and return the value (command word) if any.

** *Pros:* Typically constant time lookup for each prefix in the `HashMap`.
** *Cons:* More space required to store all the possible prefixes. Furthermore,
if no such prefix is contained in the mapping, takes linear time with respect to size of the map.

* **Alternative 3** Use a Prefix Tree (Trie) implementation, where the intermediate nodes are the prefixes and
leaf nodes are the valid command words.
** *Pros:* Provides a balance between time and space complexity.
** *Cons:* Potentially more complex implementation.
// end::autoComplete[]

// tag::tab[]
=== Tab feature
==== Current implementation
`UI` component consists of a `TabPanel` which stores all the `Tab` objects in the `UI` as follows.

image::tabPanel.png[Tab Panel basic class diagram]

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `TabPanel` to store all `Tab` objects.
** *Pros:* New tabs can be added easily as a class, and initialized in `TabPanel`.
This abides by the SoC principle and each tab can be managed separately from the others.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the methods for each `Tab` in the same class `TabPanel`.
Hence, all the tabs and their methods are contained in this class.
** *Pros:* Less code needed, especially if some tabs have similar or overlapping methods.
** *Cons:* Does not abide by SoC and SRP principle, since this one class would have to change for many reasons.
// end::tab[]

// tag::importcontacts[]
=== Import Contacts
==== Current Implementation

`ModelManager` now implements `readImportContactsFile` and it calls on `VersionedAddressBook`. +
`VersionAddressBook` is being called so that undo redo can work on import contacts command. +
`VersionAddressBook` extends `AddressBook` and it implements `readImportContactsFile`. +
`AddressBook` will call `readImportContactsFile` on `FileReader`. +
`FileReader` will read the provided CSV file, breaking the first line into Arrays of Strings. +
`FileReader` then take note of the index of mandatory fields:

* Name
* Email
* Phone Number

For each of the following lines until end of file, `Person` is created using index saved for each mandatory fields. +
Returned `Person` objects are then inserted into `UniquePersonsList` with validation. +
The number of successful inserts and duplicated will be returned to display after reading EOF. +

The following sequence diagram shows how the readImportContactsFile operation works:

image::ImportContactsSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

// end::importcontacts[]
=== Show Person's faculty location visually
==== Current Implementation

The displaying of the a ``Person``'s faculty is facilitated by the newly added `Faculty` field in the `Person` class. This
`Faculty` field is defined as a separate class (akin to other classes constituting the `Person` class such as `Email` and `Address`).

During the adding of ``Person``'s to the EventsPlus+ address book, the `Faculty` class will ensure that the argument passed in is that of
a valid NUS faculty. It does this via an inner enum class called `Faculties` which stores as constants the only accepted `Faculty`
argument values. The `isInEnum` method is used to check that the argument passed already exists as one of the constants.

The valid arguments allowed are namely:

* SOC (School of Computing)
* FOS (Faculty of Science)
* YLLSOM (Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine)
* FOD (Faculty of Dentistry)
* BIZ (NUS Business School)
* SDE (School of Design and Environment)
* FOE (Faculty of Engineering)
* FOL (Faculty of Law)
* YSTCOM (Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music)
* FASS (Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences)

A "-" response is also allowed as it is possible that the address book may indeed have contacts who are not in NUS at the
current point in time.

The command used to display the faculty visually is `showLocation`.

In addition to the `Faculty` field, the showLocation command is assisted by Google Maps Embed API that allows for locations
to be displayed visually in a separate tab, Location Display Tab. Google Maps uses unique Place IDs to identify locations
on the map. For each faculty, these place IDs are stored in a newly created class `EmbedGoogleMaps` in the logic component of the
application. Together with the Google Maps API key, the place ID allows for the generation of the exact spot of the person's
faculty to be displayed in the Location Display Tab.

When the (correct) showLocation command is input together with the index of the individual whose faculty location is to be displayed,
the index is first checked to determine if it is correct (more than 0 and not larger than the size of the list of contacts
in the address book). Following this, the appropriate person is obtained from the `FilteredPersonList` (note: this is so as to allow
the displaying of the contact's faculty location even if the list is filtered).

A event, `FacultyLocationDisplayChangedEvent`, also newly created for this showLocation command, is posted and is then handled by `TabPanel` (which switches to the Location
Display Tab) and subsequently by `LocationDisplayPanel`. The status message will show "Selected person: [INDEX] faculty location being displayed."

If the contact has no faculty, a default location - University Hall - is displayed on the map.

The above-mentioned information can be represented in the following sequence diagram:

image::showLocation_UI_LogicManager_seqDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

image::showLocation_EventsCenter_seqDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

//tag::meetinglocation[]
=== Generate a random meeting location for event

The generation of a random meeting location primarily builds upon the visual display of a ``Person``'s faculty. However
there are a few key differences in the process that one needs to take note of.

The command used to generate this possible meeting location is `generateLocation`.

In order to generate a random location for an event, the user needs to input (in addition to the command) the event name,
event date and event time. This is to detect the unique event (because some events may have the same name) and to ensure
that this event is currently in the address book.

Command parsing is handled in a similar manner as other commands but there exists a specific GenerateLocationCommandParser to specifically parse
these kind of commands. The GenerateLocationCommand object created will then consist of three fields:

* Event name
* Event date
* Event start time

The values for these fields are based on the input given by the user. These values are checked for validity as per other event-related
commands before the object is created. Following this, the address book is checked to determine whether this event does
exist and if it does the status message indicates that a meeting location has been generated, if not it indicates to the user
that such as event does not exist.

A random meeting location is generated based on 7 locations (for now) that have their Google Maps Place IDs stored in the EmbedGoogleMaps class.
A call to the method that generates this location (more specifically, returns the Place ID of the location) is made in the execute
method of the GenerateLocationCommand.

Following this, a event, `RandomMeetingLocationGeneratedEvent`, newly created for this generateLocation command, is posted and is then handled by `TabPanel` (which switches to the Location
Display Tab) and subsequently by `LocationDisplayPanel`.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, EventsPlus+ depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

Typical university student who

* needs to manage a significant number of contacts from various social circles in and out of school
* is usually kept busy due to many classes from different faculties and/or other commitments
* finds it difficult to juggle the task of contacting different members across different module projects
* finds it difficult to determine convenient timings / locations for meetings
* is reasonably comfortable with Command Line Interface (CLI) apps
* prefers typing to mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* can type fast
* prefers desktop apps

*Value proposition*: A convenient and time-saving command-line interface event manager for university students

Our enhanced Addressbook application will offer its users the following benefits:

* Avoid contact duplication, so the user has a clean and well-maintained address book.
* Show location of a person's faculty visually, so that it is easier for user to see the location
(and can even use the embedded Google Maps to show walking directions).
* Provide suggested locations for events or meetings to prevent the need for the user to spend energy thinking
about where the group can meet by providing a list of locations that can be considered.
* Notifications to alert the user to favourited events
* Allow the user to import contacts from an external source
* Allow the user to manage events neatly in the address book, so that he/she can avoid event clashes.
