== PROJECT: EventsPlus+

---

== Overview

EventsPlus+ is a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop address book application catered for busy university students to
manage their contacts, events, project meetings and ad-hoc events efficiently.
It aims to simplify some of the more time-consuming administrative tasks
such as coordinating location and date of ad-hoc events.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has more than 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#=undefined&search=kaitingpeck[RepoSense]]
* *Major enhancement*: added the *Events feature*
** What it does: Allows the user to manage events with event tags and reference to existing contacts in EventsPlus+.
** Justification: Users should be able to use the application to manage his/her events, and should be able to incorporate
contacts in EventsPlus+ into events, since both are features of the application.
** Highlights: Users are able to view the crucial person information from events by hovering over the contact in the event,
without searching for the person directly. Event tags are standardized based on a list of event tags displayed, which can
be modified by the user. This feature sets the foundation for the inclusion of more event-related functionalities in future.

* *Other enhancements*:
