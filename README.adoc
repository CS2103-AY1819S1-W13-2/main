A [blue]*convenient* and [green]*time-saving* command-line interface event manager for university students. With this
one-stop shop
for managing contacts and events, a few lines and you’re all set!
""

* EventsPlus+ is a desktop Address Book application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java application catered for busy university students to manage their contacts, events, project meetings and ad-hoc
 efficiently. EventsPlus+ aims to simplify some of the more time-consuming administrative tasks such as coordinating location and date of ad-hoc events
 using a *Command Line Interface* (CLI).
* This application includes the following features:
** A sophisticated GUI that includes a list panel and an in-built Browser.
** Support for _Build Automation_ using Gradle and for _Continuous Integration_ using Travis CI.

* With this application, you can

** Avoid contact duplication, so the user has a clean and well-maintained address book.
** Provide suggested locations and timings for events or meetings based on participants’ locations and timetable. This eases for the user the process of asking people for available timings / places to meet, by automating it.
** Notifications to alert the user to favourited events
** Allow the user to import contacts from an external source
** Allow the user to manage events neatly in the address book, so that he/she can avoid event clashes.
